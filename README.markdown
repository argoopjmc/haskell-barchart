barchart is a command-line program with associated Haskell library for
generating bar charts from CSV files.

## install

## use

Bar charts can be created from CSV files using the `barchart`
command-line utility. We can create a chart of the top five most
popular Haskell packages (as of march 2009, I did not find more recent
data) by creating a file `top5.csv` with the following contents:

    xmonad,35428
    HTTP,26203
    zlib,24431
    Cabal,23691
    X11,21563
