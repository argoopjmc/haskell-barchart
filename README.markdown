barchart is a command-line program with associated Haskell library for
generating bar charts from CSV files. It has special support for
creating charts from data generated by the Haskell benchmarking tools
[criterion] and [progression]. barchart uses the Haskell [Diagrams]
library for rendering and, hence, depends on a Haskell binding to
Cairo which is part of [Gtk2Hs].

## install

## use

Bar charts can be created from CSV files using the `barchart`
command-line utility. We can create a chart of the top five most
popular Haskell packages (as of march 2009, I did not find more recent
data) by creating a file `top5.csv` with the following contents:

    xmonad,35428
    HTTP,26203
    zlib,24431
    Cabal,23691
    X11,21563

The call

    # barchart -t "Top 5 Haskell Packages" -x Package -y "#Downloads" top5.csv 

creates a file `top5.png` which looks loke this:

![Top 5 Haskell Packages](examples/top5.png)
